# Ephemeral Development Environment Demo using Humanitec

This repository serves as a demonstration of how to use Humanitec to create temporary development environments. With this approach, every time a developer starts working on a new feature or bug fix, they can easily spin up a new development environment that is a carbon copy of the production environment. This helps eliminate problems caused by differences between development and production setups, and allows for faster development cycles.

## How it works

- A developer creates a new branch and pull request in their repository
- A Github Action is triggered which creates a new ephemeral environment in Humanitec
- The developer can then make changes to their code and push them to the branch
- The Github Action will automatically build and deploy the new code to the ephemeral environment
- The developer can then test their changes in the ephemeral environment
- Once the developer is satisfied with their changes, they can merge the pull request
- The ephemeral environment is automatically deleted
- The changes are automatically deployed to the production environment
